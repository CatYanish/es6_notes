# Object Orientated Programming

## A Case for Object Orientated Programming
In old languages, like Cobol and Assembly, programs were written in a monolithic manner. It had familiar components like Variables written at the top with functions and subroutines in the middle and so on, but when writing large applications, this proved to be problematic. In the 1980s, OOP languages started to gain popularity. 

OOP allowed programs to be written as ‘mini-programs’, each handling a specific part of functionality of the main application. Each object contained its own data and its own logic. The objects are then used to communicate with each other. Each of these objects represents groups of functionality within your application, such as videos, images, and employees, game pieces, and so on. 

Object Orientation is what is referred to as a ‘Programming Paradigm’. Not a language in itself, but rather a set of ideas all languages can use.
